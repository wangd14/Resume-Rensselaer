Resume Rensselaer README
Team 12 - Jake Mandel, Zack Paton, Shreya Kumar, David Wang, Xin Chao Chen 

September - 
To start our project we first brainstormed for a few days. We came up with a problem that we all had - 
applying to internships and how difficult this can be. This is where we came up with the idea of a 
resume nuilding website. We could use javascript to transfer general information from a simple form 
onto a fully complete, and presentable resume. After we came up with the idea, we came up with the name, 
logo, colorscheme, and basic design layout. We started the code with just some simple HTML pages 
with the basic information. 

October -
After we had the basics down, we began creating the different pages for the website. This included a 
homepage with our slogan, an about us page, a services page, and contact us page with every teammates'
contact. We made a login page to start the profile creation part of the website as well. Finally, we 
used javascript forms to get a user's information, and made 5 different templates that could display it. 
At this point we gave our midterm presentation with our fully functional website with completed 
front-end, with a javascript only backend. 

November - 
After we completed the front-end of the website, we began working on the back-end. To start, we completed
the resume creation function in Javascript. Then we used PHP to a database of account information for 
users to log in. This way we can have a working account system that saves your information after you log in. 

December - 
After completing the main functions of the website we went on to finalize the CSS and make every page 
consistent. We found a colorcheme we like and added pictures and more description to the menus. We made some 
finishing touches and created our slideshow to present the final product to the class.
